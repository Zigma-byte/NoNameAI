# NoNameAI

A totally *stupid* AI that **doesn’t need the internet** or any fancy APIs — it’s 100% offline and useless, but hilarious if you teach it dumb stuff like "sigma" or "skibidi."

## What even is NoNameAI?

NoNameAI is basically just a dumb chatbot that talks back in the weirdest ways. No smart algorithms here, just pure nonsense. It’s made for fun, zero practical use, and it definitely doesn’t know what it’s doing.

---

## Features (if you want to call them that)

- Runs **offline** because who wants to pay for APIs?
- Responds with random nonsense — sometimes kinda funny, sometimes just plain weird.
- Learns from you — but if you teach it slurs, prepare for its villain arc. You’ve been warned.
- Light on resources — it won’t slow down your toaster.

## Example conversation (I swear this actually happened)


Me: sigma balls

AI: Sigma balls

Me: so
AI: Thanks

Me: stop it
AI: Going

Me: what
AI: Are an ai

Me: gang bang you
AI: Are an ai

Me: NO
AI: Problem

Me: SHUT THE F#CK UP
AI: F#ck up

Me: no, im the sigma rizzler and the sigma god
AI: Problem


If you teach it bad words, it might go full villain on you. It’s an AI with an attitude problem.

## How to use this dumb thing
Just type random words?

## Why would you even?
Just type stuff and watch this idiot talk back. Expect nonsense. Don’t expect actual intelligence.

Wanna help?
Sure, fork it if you want to fix this mess or add new ridiculous responses. Pull requests welcome but don’t expect miracles.

## Disclaimer (because lawyers exist)
This AI is purely for laughs and maybe some mild brain damage. It can say dumb or offensive stuff if you feed it bad input. Use responsibly… or don’t.
